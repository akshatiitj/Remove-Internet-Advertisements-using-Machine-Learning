The objective is to create a classifier model which can find out whether an image in a web-page is an Advertisement or not based on its features. A research paper ‘Learning to remove advertisements’ by Nicholas Kushmerick was studied to gain proper insights on the features of data. Noise removal and pre-processing of data was done. After pre-processing steps, a feed forward neural network-multiple layer perceptron was used for the classification model. Total data set was divided into training, validation & test data sets. Finally training and testing of the model was done using respective data sets. The model accuracy was found out to be 98.4 percent for test data.
